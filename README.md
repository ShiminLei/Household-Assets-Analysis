# Introduction

The Federal Reserve Board’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) collects information about family incomes, net worth, balance sheet components, credit use, and other financial outcomes. The value of assets held by households is an important index related to social stability. The study aims to addresses the need of the Federal Reserve Board, which is to find that which factors contribute more on the high value of assets held by households.

# Data

Data collected by Federal Reserve Board.

# Method

1. Clean and visualize the household assets data from Federal Reserve Board, analyze the main feature and raise basic assumptions.
2. Use PCA and Generalized Linear Models to verify hypothesis and analyze the highly contributed factors.
3. Select the best fitting model and make model evaluation, explore the strategy to balance the household assets.
4. **Tools**：Machine learning, Data visualization, Statistical analysis, R programming, ggplot2

# Conclusion

This study show that factors like age, race, gender, occupation type and some interaction factors will have significant effect on the high value of assets. Based on the analysis, we recommend: 

1. Pay attention to households whose household head is female and to find out why their total value of assets is much lower than male household.
2. Lay emphasis on employment opportunities, promotion opportunities and salaries of non-white people.
3. Help people with lower income get more education to improve their living situation.
